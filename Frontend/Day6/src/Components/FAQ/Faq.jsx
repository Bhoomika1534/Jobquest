        answer: 'For recruiters, it is essential to be where their job seekers are. Integrating social media allows users to share jobs on leading social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google +. Promote it through digital marketing services and establish a voice for your job board. Post frequently, but make sure those posts are relevant. Post a mix of jobs, career content, and information about the role.'

        question: ' Should the job portal be free or paid?',
        answer: 'Most of the job seekers donâ€™t pay to the job portals, as most of them are fresher and they are not financially secure. But at the same time, experienced candidates pay as they need quality services of the recruitment portal. Even, top companies pay the portals, if the organization needs a qualified candidate.'
